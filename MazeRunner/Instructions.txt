THE MAZE CHALLENGE
------------------

There is an API where you can:

- Generate mazes.
- Start a game inside a previously generated maze.
- Inside a game, move around the maze until you reach the end of the maze.
(see APISpecs.txt for more info about the API)


In this test you have to choose one of two options.

- Make a console app where automatically (without user interaction):
  - creates a maze of 25x25
  - starts a game
  - send movements to reach the end of the maze with some kind of clever algorithm.

OR 

- Make a user interface where the user can:
  - generate a new maze, 
  - start a game inside the maze 
  - move around the maze using some kind of controls
  - Graph some kind of map conform you are advancing in the maze.


There is no restriction about the tools and libraries in case you need one. Good luck¡¡
